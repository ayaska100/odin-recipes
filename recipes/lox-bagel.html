  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This is the quintessential NYC style bagel sandwich. It holds significance
    to the jewish community for many reasons, one of which being kashrut not
    allowing meat and dairy in the same dish. Fish is an exception to this
    rule, so it makes a great choice. It's also plain yummy!
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Bagel of sorts, preferably Sesame or Everything</li>
    <li>Cream Cheese</li>
    <li>Lox (Smoked salmon)</li>
    <li>Capers</li>
    <li>Onions: pickled, raw, red, white, whatever floats your boat</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Slice and toast your bagel!</li>
    <li>Spread a generous layer of cream cheese across each face.</li>
    <li>
      Sprinkle a handful of capers straight onto the cream cheese.
      <strong>Pro tip</strong>: Pressing them into the cream cheese prevents
      them from rolling out and making a huge mess.
    </li>
    <li>Lay on a few slices of cold lox.</li>
    <li>Garnish with onions of some sort.</li>
    <li>Enjoy open faced or closed and sliced!</li>
  </ol>
